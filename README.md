# Windows-Port-Forwarder
Utility to forward ports on a machine

This little utility calls through to the Windows netsh command to register port forwarding on a maachine. 

You can:
* List the port forwarding rules that are setup on the machine
* Add a new port forwarding rule
* Delete an existing port forwarding rule

It also shows you the actual netsh command that is executed you can add to setup scripts for automation.
